# What is ZLC?
# ZLC is the token abbreviation for ZelaaCoin, which stands for creating dynamic products & platforms to mainstream cryptocurrencies and acheive mass adaptability for the same.

# While existing solutions & products offer valuable services to the crypto realm, we differentiate ourselves by enhancing our physical presence through our hardware based crypto vending machines that stream advertisements & enables the general public to buy or sell their cryptocurrencies on the machines at a zero-percent transaction fee.

# Zelaa does not just stop here, we are rapidly evolving and developing a financial ecosystem too by releasing our micropayments application starting with ZLC acceptance but as we grow, other cryptocurrencies can leverage upon our services too.


# ZelaaPay is our QR-based micro-payments application that you can use to pay your bills at the merchants partnered with us across the world using ZLC. The entire transactional system is based on the same leverage as the token, the Ethereum blockchain. We on-board merchants and you see a "ZLC accepted here" sign at their outlets, you can pay them with your ZLC using the ZPay App.
